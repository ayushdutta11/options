# Black Scholes vs Binomial Estimate for Tesla Options Project [Working]
This project compares the Black Scholes Pricing Model against the Binomial Option Pricing Model to discover a statistically significant difference in the models’ estimates for a one year period for Tesla (TSLA) stock. The process of this project required a fundamental dive into the basics of puts, calls, and the basics of pricing options along with a practiced background implementation for statistical analyses in Python. I fetched and extracted the year’s historical data as the control, and developed working, defined functions for both models. After running, the program presented an estimated mean-error plot, a line graph comparing the model’s estimates with the historical ask prices during the period, and summary statistics to draw conclusions for each model.
